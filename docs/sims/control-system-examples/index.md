## Description

This interactive infographic helps students identify and classify control systems in everyday contexts. The MicroSim presents six familiar examples arranged in a 3x2 grid:

**Open-Loop Systems (Orange border):**

- **Toaster** - Runs for a set time regardless of bread color
- **Washing Machine** - Fixed cycle that doesn't measure cleanliness
- **Fixed Traffic Light** - Changes on a timer without detecting traffic

**Closed-Loop Systems (Blue border):**

- **Thermostat** - Measures temperature and adjusts heating/cooling
- **Cruise Control** - Uses speedometer feedback to maintain speed
- **Smart Traffic Light** - Detects vehicles and adjusts timing

Click on any example to reveal detailed information about its input, output, and whether feedback is present.

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** control systems in everyday contexts
2. **Classify** systems as either open-loop or closed-loop
3. **Explain** the role of feedback in closed-loop systems
4. **Recognize** that open-loop systems cannot automatically correct for disturbances

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 minutes)
- Ask students: "What do a toaster and cruise control have in common?"
- Introduce the concept that both are control systems, but they work differently

### Guided Exploration (10 minutes)
1. Have students click on each example in the grid
2. For each example, ask them to identify:
   - What is being controlled (the output)?
   - What information does the system use (the input)?
   - Does the system measure its actual output?

### Classification Activity (10 minutes)
- Students work in pairs to sort the six examples into two categories
- Discuss: What is the key difference between the two groups?
- Introduce the terms "open-loop" and "closed-loop"

### Discussion Questions
1. Why might a toaster burn your bread sometimes? (No feedback about actual toast color)
2. How does cruise control maintain speed going uphill? (Measures actual speed and adjusts)
3. Which type of traffic light would work better in a busy city? Why?

### Extension Activity
Ask students to find three more examples of control systems in their homes or school. For each example, they should determine:

- Is it open-loop or closed-loop?
- What would happen if conditions change unexpectedly?
