## Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Prerequisites**: The prerequisites section provides specific mathematical and technical skills, ensuring students are properly prepared.

2. **Well-Defined Scope**: The "Concepts NOT covered" section clearly bounds the course to classical, continuous-time, SISO control using transfer function methods.

3. **Complete Bloom's Taxonomy Coverage**: All six cognitive levels are addressed with multiple specific, actionable outcomes per level (6 outcomes each).

4. **Logical Topic Organization**: Topics flow naturally from foundations through modeling, analysis, and design.

5. **ABET Alignment**: Explicit mention of ABET alignment signals accreditation-ready design.

6. **Clear Audience Definition**: Multiple engineering disciplines identified with qualification requirements.

## Estimated Concept Count

Based on the course description, approximately **180-220 concepts** can be derived:

- Foundations: ~15 concepts
- System Modeling: ~25 concepts
- Laplace Transform Methods: ~20 concepts
- Block Diagrams and Signal Flow: ~15 concepts
- Time-Domain Analysis: ~25 concepts
- Stability Analysis: ~25 concepts
- Frequency-Domain Analysis: ~30 concepts
- Controller Design: ~30 concepts
- Computer-Aided Analysis: ~15 concepts
- Cross-cutting concepts and applications: ~20 concepts

This is consistent with similar undergraduate control systems courses at accredited institutions.

## Recommendation
