## Category Descriptions

### FOUND - Foundation Concepts
Core vocabulary and fundamental building blocks including control system, feedback, open/closed-loop control, plant, controller, actuator, sensor, and basic signal definitions.

### PROP - System Properties
Characteristics of systems including linearity, time-invariance, LTI properties, superposition, causality, and system order concepts.

### TIME - Time Response
Analysis of system behavior in time domain including natural/forced response, transient specifications (overshoot, settling time, rise time), damping, and response to standard test inputs.

### LAPL - Laplace Methods
Mathematical tools for system analysis including Laplace transforms, s-domain representation, poles, zeros, partial fractions, and transfer function properties.

### MODEL - Physical Modeling
Modeling of real systems including electrical circuits (RLC, RC, RL, op-amp), mechanical systems (mass-spring-damper, pendulum, gears), motors, and analogous system concepts.

### LINEAR - Linearization
Handling of nonlinear systems including linearization at operating points, Taylor series expansion, and common nonlinearities (saturation, dead zone, backlash, hysteresis).
