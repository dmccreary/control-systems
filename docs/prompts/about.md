Please create the content for the @about.md page.  Make the first section focus on why control theory is       
  an important class in the EE curriculum and whey this intelligent interactive textbook uses AI to create       
  the best possible learning experience for student around the world.  This is part of our international         
  effort to democratize education for students that can't attend expensive colleges and universities.  The       
  book is designed to work with a broad audience and give students with limited math backgrounds an              
  intuitive understanding of control theory.  Add a section on ## Background.  In this section, describe how     
  I started mentoring kids in a STEM class through a CoderDojo program.  I got my first two-wheel self           
  balancing robot and I started to tune the PID values in my Arduino code.  I didn't understand a lot of         
  what I was doing, but I did have a wonderful time working with the students.  The PID functions was my         
  first gateway into control theory.  I slowly realized how important it was is so many consumer products        
  like the MIP robot.  I spent many hours with MIP in classrooms showing students how it worked and how it       
  balanced even if we added weight to its arms.  My STEM robotics students got their first exposure to           
  control theory through the MIP robot.  My goal was to create a "virtual MIP experinces" for all the            
  readers of this book. - Dan McCreary, Feb 1, 2026
