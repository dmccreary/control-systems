# Physical System Modeling

## Summary

This chapter develops the skills to create mathematical models of real physical systems. Students will learn to derive differential equations and transfer functions for electrical circuits (RC, RL, RLC, op-amp), mechanical systems (translational and rotational including mass-spring-dampers, pendulums, and gear trains), and electromechanical systems (DC motors). The chapter also introduces analogous system concepts that reveal deep connections between electrical and mechanical domains, enabling engineers to apply insights across disciplines.
