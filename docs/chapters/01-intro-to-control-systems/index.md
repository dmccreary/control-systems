# Introduction to Control Systems

## Summary

This chapter introduces the fundamental vocabulary and building blocks of control systems. Students will learn the difference between open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control, and understand the roles of key system components including the plant, controller, actuator, and sensor. By the end of this chapter, students will be able to identify and describe the basic elements of any control system and explain how feedback enables systems to regulate their behavior.
