# Poles, Zeros, and System Analysis

## Summary

This chapter explores the critical relationship between a system's poles and zeros and its dynamic behavior. Students will learn to construct and interpret pole-zero plots, understand different pole types (real, complex conjugate, repeated, simple), and recognize how pole locations in the s-plane determine stability and response characteristics. The concept of dominant poles is introduced as a practical tool for approximating higher-order system behavior. System order and proper transfer function properties complete the analysis framework.
