# Root Locus Analysis and Design

## Summary

This chapter develops the root locus method for analyzing how closed-loop poles move as a system parameter (typically gain) varies. Students will learn the rules for constructing root locus plots including starting/ending points, real-axis segments, asymptotes, breakaway points, and angles of departure/arrival. The magnitude and angle conditions provide the mathematical foundation. Root locus techniques are extended to controller design, enabling engineers to select gains that place poles at desired locations. Dominant pole design and compensation concepts prepare students for systematic controller synthesis.
