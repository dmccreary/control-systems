# Laplace Transform Methods

## Summary

This chapter introduces the Laplace transform as a powerful tool for analyzing control systems. Students will learn to transform differential equations into algebraic equations in the s-domain, work with transfer functions, and use inverse Laplace transforms to find time-domain solutions. Key techniques including partial fraction expansion, residue calculation, and the cover-up method are developed. The initial and final value theorems provide shortcuts for determining system behavior without complete inverse transformation.
