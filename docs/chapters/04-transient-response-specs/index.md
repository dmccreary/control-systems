# Transient Response Specifications

## Summary

This chapter focuses on quantitative measures used to specify and evaluate transient response performance. Students will learn to calculate and interpret key metrics including overshoot, percent overshoot, settling time, rise time, peak time, and delay time. The chapter also introduces the standard test inputs (step, impulse, ramp, parabolic, and sinusoidal) used throughout control systems analysis. By the end of this chapter, students will be able to specify performance requirements and evaluate whether a system meets those requirements.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Overshoot
2. Percent Overshoot
3. Settling Time
4. Rise Time
5. Peak Time

7. Step Input
8. Impulse Input
9. Ramp Input
10. Parabolic Input
11. Sinusoidal Input
12. Unit Step Response
13. Impulse Response
14. Ramp Response
15. Standard Test Inputs
