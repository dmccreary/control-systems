# Time-Domain Response Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter develops understanding of how systems respond to inputs over time. Students will learn to distinguish between natural and forced responses, transient and steady-state behavior, and the characteristics of first-order and second-order systems. Key parameters including time constant, damping ratio, and natural frequency are introduced, along with the classification of second-order systems as underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped. These concepts are essential for predicting and specifying system performance.
