# Frequency Response and Bode Plots

## Summary

This chapter introduces frequency-domain analysis as a powerful complement to time-domain methods. Students will learn to characterize system behavior using sinusoidal steady-state response, magnitude and phase relationships, and the substitution s=jω. Bode plots are developed as graphical tools showing magnitude (in decibels) and phase versus frequency on logarithmic scales. Systematic construction techniques for first-order, second-order, integrator, and differentiator terms are presented. The chapter also covers bandwidth, cutoff frequency, resonance phenomena, and filter characteristics (low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, notch).
