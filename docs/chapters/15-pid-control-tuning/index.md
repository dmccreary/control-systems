# PID Control and Controller Tuning

## Summary

This chapter introduces the most widely used controller structure in industrial applications: the PID controller. Students will learn how proportional, integral, and derivative control actions individually affect system behavior, and how they combine in P, PI, PD, and PID controllers. Controller gains and their equivalent time-domain parameters (integral time, derivative time) are explained. Systematic tuning methods including Ziegler-Nichols (reaction curve and ultimate gain methods) provide starting points for controller design. Practical considerations including anti-windup and derivative kick are addressed.
