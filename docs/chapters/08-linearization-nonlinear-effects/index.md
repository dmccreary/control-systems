# Linearization and Nonlinear Effects

## Summary

This chapter addresses the challenge of analyzing systems that are inherently nonlinear. Students will learn to identify operating points and equilibrium conditions, apply Taylor series expansion to linearize nonlinear system equations, and perform small-signal analysis around operating points. The chapter also introduces common nonlinear phenomena encountered in real systems including saturation, dead zones, backlash, and hysteresis. Understanding these effects helps engineers anticipate when linear analysis may be insufficient.
