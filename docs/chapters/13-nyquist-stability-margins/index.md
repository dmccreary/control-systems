# Nyquist Analysis and Stability Margins

## Summary

This chapter extends frequency-domain analysis to stability determination. Students will learn to construct Nyquist diagrams (polar plots of loop transfer functions) and apply the Nyquist stability criterion based on encirclements of the critical point. Gain margin and phase margin are developed as quantitative measures of how far a system is from instability, providing crucial robustness information. The chapter also covers minimum-phase and non-minimum-phase systems, right-half-plane poles and zeros, and conditionally stable systems. These concepts connect frequency response directly to closed-loop stability.
