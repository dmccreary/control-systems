## How to Use This Textbook

The chapters are organized to respect concept dependencies—each chapter builds on knowledge from previous chapters. Students should work through the chapters sequentially, as later topics assume familiarity with earlier material. The learning graph visualization shows how concepts connect across the textbook.
