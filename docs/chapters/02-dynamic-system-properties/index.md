# Dynamic System Properties

## Summary

This chapter establishes the essential mathematical properties that characterize dynamic systems suitable for control analysis. Students will learn the definitions of linearity, time-invariance, and the combined LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) property that underlies most classical control theory. The chapter also covers superposition, homogeneity, causality, and the role of differential equations in describing system dynamics. These properties form the foundation for all subsequent analysis techniques.
