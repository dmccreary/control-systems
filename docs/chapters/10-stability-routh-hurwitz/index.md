# Stability Analysis and the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion

## Summary

This chapter introduces the critical concept of stability in feedback control systems. Students will learn multiple stability definitions including BIBO (bounded-input, bounded-output), asymptotic, and marginal stability, and understand how these relate to pole locations. The characteristic equation and polynomial are developed as tools for stability analysis. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion provides an algebraic method to determine stability without solving for poles directly. Special cases including zeros in the first column and rows of zeros are addressed. Relative stability concepts introduce the idea that some stable systems are more stable than others.
