# Compensator Design and Performance Tradeoffs

## Summary

This chapter develops systematic methods for designing lead and lag compensators to meet performance specifications. Students will learn how phase lead improves transient response and stability margins while phase lag improves steady-state accuracy. Design procedures using both Bode plots and root locus are presented, enabling engineers to choose the approach best suited to given specifications. The chapter concludes with performance tradeoffs including the fundamental tension between speed and stability, sensitivity functions, robustness concepts, and the handling of disturbances and noise in feedback systems.
