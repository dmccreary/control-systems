# Steady-State Error Analysis

## Summary

This chapter focuses on the accuracy of control systems in tracking reference inputs after transients have settled. Students will learn to calculate steady-state errors for step, ramp, and parabolic inputs using error constants (position, velocity, and acceleration). The system type classification based on the number of integrators in the open-loop transfer function provides a systematic way to predict steady-state accuracy. The chapter also addresses how disturbances affect steady-state performance and how controller design can reduce or eliminate steady-state errors.
