# Intelligent Textbook Feature Checklist

This checklist helps authors and product managers understand what features are available in the MkDocs Material intelligent textbook ecosystem. For each feature, you'll see whether it's implemented in this book and how much effort it takes to add.

!!! note
    A level 2+ textbook is one that has rich interactivity but does not store any
    personal student data. A level 2+ textbook can be converted to a level 3
    textbook by sending event data to a learning record store (LRS) to create
    a hyper-personalized learning experience for each student. The five levels
    of intelligent textbooks are described in the [Intelligent Textbooks](https://dmccreary.github.io/intelligent-textbooks/) course.

An **intelligent textbook** goes beyond static text to include interactive simulations, personalized learning paths, auto-graded quizzes, and AI-generated content. This checklist tracks which of these capabilities are present in this textbook.

**Legend:**

- :white_check_mark: Feature is implemented and working
- :x: Feature is not yet implemented
- :construction: Feature is partially implemented

## Quick Start: Adding Missing Features

Start with the easiest wins and work your way up.

### Highest Impact, Lowest Effort

These can be done in under an hour:

1. **License page** - Copy the standard Creative Commons template
2. **Contact page** - Add author email or feedback form
3. **Edit page button** - One line in `mkdocs.yml` enables "Suggest an edit" links
4. **Social media cards** - Auto-generate preview images when shared

### Medium Effort, High Value

These use Claude Code skills to generate content:

1. **Glossary** - Use the glossary-generator skill to create searchable definitions
2. **FAQ** - Use the faq-generator skill to answer common student questions
3. **Book metrics** - Use the book-metrics-generator skill to track completeness
4. **Per-chapter quizzes** - Use the quiz-generator skill for auto-graded practice

### High Effort, Transformative

These take more time but significantly enhance the learning experience:

1. **Additional MicroSims** - Each simulation takes 2-4 hours; aim for 10-20 total
2. **AI-generated infographics** - Requires paid image generation subscription
3. **Instructor's guide** - Helps teachers adopt your textbook
