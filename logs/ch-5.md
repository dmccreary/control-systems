## Gyra Integration

Gyra moments were included to connect abstract concepts to physical intuition:

1. The Laplace transform reveals Gyra's dynamics as a transfer function (Laplace Transform section)
2. The Final Value Theorem predicts where Gyra will stabilize—if she's stable (Final Value Theorem section)
