### Key Equations

- Characteristic equation: $1 + KG(s)H(s) = 0$
- Angle condition: $\angle G(s)H(s) = (2k+1) \times 180°$
- Magnitude condition: $|G(s)H(s)| = 1/K$
- Asymptote angles: $\phi_k = (2k+1) \times 180°/(n-m)$
- Centroid: $\sigma_c = (\sum poles - \sum zeros)/(n-m)$
- Departure angle formula
- Breakaway condition: $dK/ds = 0$
