## Gyra Integration

Three Gyra Moments included:
1. Opening context on steady-state error as "slight lean"
2. Explanation of how integrators feel from Gyra's perspective
3. Disturbance rejection as Gyra's nemesis

## Style Notes

- Conversational academic tone maintained throughout
- Technical terminology introduced with clear definitions
- Real-world analogies (cruise control, thermostat, telescopes)
- Mathematical rigor appropriate for college level
- Dry wit sprinkled appropriately ("There's no free lunch in control design")
- Active voice preferred
- Complex equations rendered in LaTeX with single dollar signs

## MicroSims to Implement

The following MicroSims need to be created:

1. `unity-feedback-structure` - Animated block diagram
2. `system-type-classification` - Three-column infographic
3. `error-constants-calculator` - Interactive calculator
4. `type-zero-response` - Gain vs. error visualization
5. `steady-state-error-comparison` - Side-by-side system comparison
6. `disturbance-rejection` - P vs. PI disturbance response
7. `design-tradeoffs` - Multi-objective gauge display

## Notes

- Chapter follows natural pedagogical flow from concept to application
- Master table (System Type vs. Input Type) highlighted for memorization
- Self-check questions included at end for student assessment
- Prerequisites properly linked to earlier chapters
- Ready for MicroSim implementation phase
