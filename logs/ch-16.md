## Gyra Integration

The chapter includes 5 "Gyra Moment" quote admonitions:

1. Introduction - Lead compensator as "prescription glasses"
2. Lead compensators - Phase lead as advance warning
3. Speed vs stability - Accepting tradeoffs
4. Summary - Best possible compromise philosophy

## Key Equations

1. Lead Compensator Transfer Function: $G_c(s) = K_c \cdot \frac{s + z}{s + p}$
2. Phase Lead Equation: $\phi(\omega) = \tan^{-1}(\omega/z) - \tan^{-1}(\omega/p)$
3. Maximum Phase Lead Frequency: $\omega_m = \sqrt{z \cdot p}$
4. Maximum Phase Lead: $\phi_{max} = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1 - \alpha}{1 + \alpha}\right)$
5. Lag Compensator Transfer Function: $G_c(s) = K_c \cdot \frac{s + z}{s + p}$ (with z > p)
6. Lead-Lag Transfer Function: $G_c(s) = K_c \cdot \frac{(s + z_{lead})(s + z_{lag})}{(s + p_{lead})(s + p_{lag})}$
7. Sensitivity Function: $S(s) = \frac{1}{1 + G(s)H(s)}$
8. Complementary Sensitivity: $T(s) = \frac{G(s)H(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)}$
9. Fundamental constraint: $S(s) + T(s) = 1$

- Strong emphasis on fundamental tradeoffs (S + T = 1 constraint)
- Waterbed effect introduced conceptually
- Both Bode and root locus design methods presented
- Spider/radar chart for multi-objective visualization proposed
- Systematic design workflow synthesizes course concepts
