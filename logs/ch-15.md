## Gyra Integration

The chapter includes 6 "Gyra Moment" quote admonitions connecting PID concepts to the self-balancing robot mascot:

1. Introduction - PID overview through Gyra's perspective
2. Proportional control - Standing with permanent lean
3. Derivative control - Early warning system / gyroscope sensing
4. Trial and error - Tuning process narrative
5. Anti-windup - Recovery from large disturbances
6. Summary - Three simple ideas keeping her upright

## Key Equations

1. Proportional Control Law: $u(t) = K_p \cdot e(t)$
2. Integral Control Law: $u(t) = K_i \int_0^t e(\tau) \, d\tau$
3. Derivative Control Law: $u(t) = K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}$
4. P Controller Transfer Function: $G_c(s) = K_p$
5. PI Controller Transfer Function: $G_c(s) = K_p + \frac{K_i}{s}$
6. PD Controller Transfer Function: $G_c(s) = K_p + K_d s$
7. PID Transfer Function (Parallel): $G_c(s) = K_p + \frac{K_i}{s} + K_d s$
8. PID Transfer Function (Ideal): $G_c(s) = K_p \left(1 + \frac{1}{T_i s} + T_d s\right)$
9. Ultimate Period: $T_u = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_u}$
10. Modified PID (derivative on measurement): $u(t) = K_p \cdot e(t) + K_i \int e(\tau) d\tau - K_d \frac{dy(t)}{dt}$
